Application which proves the theory of six degrees of separation.
“According to the six-degree theory of separation, each of us divides only six contacts from any chosen person in the world”.

The aim of the task is to repeat the experiment of Patrick Reynolds from 1999 (https://oracleofbacon.org/), who investigated the links 
between actors playing together in movies. 
Application uses the database of movies and actors IMDB service as the REST API as input data.

An implementation is based on an non-directed graph chart, in which the vertexes are the actors, and the edges  the film - in which they met.

Application allows to determine the shortest path between the two actors. User can give name and surname of two persons and application 
bases their ID from the IMDB website from the database. 

Short example: Brandon Lee and Ernie Hudson
